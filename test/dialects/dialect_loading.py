"""Tests for context-aware, idempotent loading of Lighthouse dialect extensions.

A Python-defined dialect is bound to the MLIR context it is loaded into, yet
MLIR forbids loading the same dialect into a context twice. These tests exercise
`register_and_load` across fresh, repeated, and interleaved contexts to ensure
loading never raises (or aborts on a C++ assertion) and that the extension ends
up registered in every context it was requested for.
