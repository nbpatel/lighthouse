        A Python-defined dialect is bound to the MLIR context it is loaded into,
        so it must be (re)loaded for every context in which it is used. MLIR,
        however, does not allow loading the same dialect into a context twice.
        This method makes loading idempotent per-context and derives the correct
        reload behavior automatically, so callers never need to know whether a
        reload is required:

        - Already loaded in the current context: no-op (reloading into the same
          context is unsupported and would assert).
        - Loaded in some *other* context but not this one: re-emit and replace
          the process-global registrations for the current context. This also
          covers coming back to a context after using a different one, since a
          dialect stays loaded in every context it was loaded into.
        - Never loaded: perform a fresh load.
