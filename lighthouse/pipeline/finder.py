    Find a pipeline descriptor file with the given name using target information to
    complete the following directory structure:

    The lookup uses an externally provided ``base_path`` first, when given, to allow
    third-party repositories to ship their own descriptors. If no matching descriptor
    is found externally, the search falls back to Lighthouse's descriptors directory.

    Args:
        target: Target information to complete the directory structure.
        pipeline: The name of the pipeline descriptor file to find.
        dtype: The data type used to select the descriptor file.
        base_path: Optional external base directory searched before the
            Lighthouse descriptors directory.

    Returns:
        The full path to the pipeline descriptor file, or None if not found.
        The feature that was used to find the pipeline file, or None
        if no feature-specific file was found.
